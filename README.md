[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

_Important Note: This project is in early development. Features are sparse and bugs may arise._

## **The Suite**

[setup.sh](setup.sh) defines some aliases, set's up the console prompt and loads **mpiP** and **OpenMP** when sourced.

You really only need loading **mpiP** and **OpenMP**. Everything else is entirely optional.

[compile.sh](compile.sh) is responsible for compiling the MPI, OpenMP or Hybrid supplied source file.

It is expecting at least one arguement, which should be the source file. Any other arguements are grouped and form pairs of keys and values. Each pair represents a macro, named **key** with a value of **value**, that is going to be defined during the compilation of the program.

[schedule.sh](schedule.sh) is responsible for generating a job and submitting it to the PBS queue.

It is expecting exactly two arguements, the executable and the number of processes that should be created.

[profile.sh](profile.sh) is responsible for compiling our program with various (key, value) macro pairs, running it with different numbers of processes and collecting our measurements.

It is expecting exactly two arguements, the source file and a [profiling description](#profiling-descriptions).

[config.sh](config.sh) contains the [configuration settings](#configuration) and is being sourced by the other files.

[ui.sh](ui.sh) offers some basic user interface components and is being sourced by the other files.

## **Installation**

    git clone https://github.com/billsioros/mpi-openmp-task-automation

## **Profiling Descriptions**

[profile.sh](./profile.sh) is expecting a profiling description, which **must** define:

* a string named **MACRO**, containing the name of the macro that should be defined by [compile.sh](./compile.sh).
* an array named **VALUES**, containing the values that macro **MACRO** should receive in different runs.

## **Configuration**

* **COMPILER** indicates the script that should be used to compile the source file.
* **SCHEDULER** indicates the script that should be used to schedule the executable's run.
* **OUTPUT_ROOT** indicates the directory, under which the files and directories generated by our scheduler and profiler are going to be saved.
* **USER_ID** is being used when querying the job queue to check if a job is done running.
* **TIME_PATTERN** is a regular expression indicating the format of our timer's output.
* **EDITOR** and **EDITOR_ARGS** are optional and are used by the profiler to open files in your favorite editor.

## **Example**

Let' s assume we would like to estimate the integral from a to b of an equation f(x) using the trapezoidal rule.

Let' s also assume that we have already developed an **MPI** program, named **mpi_trap.c** to do so and this program defines a macro named **nTraps**, which corresponds to the **number of trapezoids** that are going to be used in the calculation of the integral.

Firstly, we need to source [setup.sh](setup.sh) like so

    . ./setup.sh

### **Compiling**

We now need to compile our source file using [compile.sh](compile.sh) as follows

    ./compile.sh mpi_trap.c nTraps 512

    [compile.sh] enable profiling: y
    [compile.sh] link OpenMP: n

This results in the creation of an executable file named **mpi_trap.x**.

Executing [compile.sh](compile.sh) with the _--clean_ option deletes the executable.

### **Scheduling**

Scheduling the executable can be achieved like so

    ./schedule.sh mpi_trap.x 16

    [schedule.sh] name='mpi_trap1_16_argo059_job', id='14524.argo', ps=16, ns=2, ppn=8

    Job id            Name             User              Time Use S Queue
    ----------------  ---------------- ----------------  -------- - -----
    12507.argo        myJob            argo081                  0 Q workq
    14524.argo        mpi_trap1_16_ar  argo059           00:00:00 R workq

This results in the following files and directories to be generated

    find ./out

    ./out/
    ./out/16
    ./out/16/21_11_2019
    ./out/16/21_11_2019/15_06_30
    ./out/16/21_11_2019/15_06_30/mpi_trap1_16_argo059_job.stderr
    ./out/16/21_11_2019/15_06_30/mpi_trap1_16_argo059_job.stdout

* **ps** stands for the **number of processes**
* **ns** stands for the **number of nodes**
* **ppn** stands for the **number of processes per node**

Executing [schedule.sh](schedule.sh) with the _--clean_ option removes any mpiP associated file, any job file generated by it and removes any associated job from the queue.

### **Profiling**

We firstly need to define a [profiling description](#profiling-descriptions) like so

```bash
#!/bin/bash

MACRO="nTraps"

VALUES=()

for ((power = 20; power <= 28; power += 2))
do
    VALUES+=( "$(( 2 << ($power - 1) ))" )
done
```

We can schedule the same executable multiple times with different numbers of trapezoids and processes as follows

    echo -e "y\nn\ny\nn\ny\nn\ny\nn\ny\nn\n" | ./profile.sh ./mpi_trap.c ./description.sh

The _echo_ command is used so that [compile.sh](compile.sh) runs non-interactively.

This results in the following files and directories to be generated.

    find ./out

    ./out/
    ./out/21_11_2019
    ./out/21_11_2019/15_13_08
    ./out/21_11_2019/15_13_08/67108864
    ./out/21_11_2019/15_13_08/67108864/4
    ./out/21_11_2019/15_13_08/67108864/4/mpi_trap1_4_argo059_job.stderr
    ./out/21_11_2019/15_13_08/67108864/4/mpi_trap1_4_argo059_job.stdout
    ...
    ./out/21_11_2019/15_13_08/268435456/32
    ./out/21_11_2019/15_13_08/268435456/32/mpi_trap1_32_argo059_job.stderr
    ./out/21_11_2019/15_13_08/268435456/32/mpi_trap1_32_argo059_job.stdout
    ./out/21_11_2019/15_13_08/268435456/16
    ./out/21_11_2019/15_13_08/268435456/16/mpi_trap1_16_argo059_job.stderr
    ./out/21_11_2019/15_13_08/268435456/16/mpi_trap1_16_argo059_job.stdout
    ./out/21_11_2019/15_13_08/results.csv

We can now check out our measurements

    head -5 ./out/21_11_2019/15_13_08/results.csv
